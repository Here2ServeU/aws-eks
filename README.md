🚀 This project guides you on how to set up an Amazon EKS cluster and deploy an Nginx service using the AWS CLI! 🎉

Here are the steps: 

 1. Download this repo to your local machine and move it into the aws_cli folder to do the project using the AWS CLI. 
 2. Create an EKS cluster with the AWS CLI.
 3. Deploy an Nginx service that displays a custom message.
 4. Use kubectl to manage the Kubernetes resources.
 5. Access the service through a load balancer, confirming everything worked smoothly.

This experience was a great way to dive deeper into Kubernetes on AWS and understand how EKS can simplify the management of containerized applications at scale. 🛠️
