🚀 Just wrapped up a hands-on project where I set up an Amazon EKS cluster and deployed an Nginx service using the AWS CLI! 🎉

In this project, I:

 1. Created an EKS cluster with the AWS CLI.
 2. Deployed an Nginx service that displays a custom message.
 3. Used kubectl to manage the Kubernetes resources.
 4. Access the service through a load balancer, confirming everything worked smoothly.

This experience was a great way to dive deeper into Kubernetes on AWS and understand how EKS can simplify the management of containerized applications at scale. 🛠️
